# JavaScript module pattern

## Before the workshop starts

* Read the code in `src/` to see how it works.  Then delete it.

## Starter (15 minutes)

* Talk about the [high level goal for the week](README.md#high-level-goal-for-the-week).

* Do "thumbs" on the [learning objectives](README.md#learning-objectives).

* Develop the `exclaim.js`, `question.js`, `interrobang.js` and `app.js` modules in front of the students.  There are tests in `test/` to help.

* Do "thumbs" on the [learning objectives](README.md#learning-objectives).

## Main (30 minutes)

* Ask the students to implement `interrobangsmiley()` (see [README.md](README.md#implement-the-module-pattern-30-mins)).

* Ask them to try and answer the [questions](README.md#questions) in the README.

## Plenary (15 minutes)

* Ask the students if they had any problems implementing `interrobangsmiley()`.

* Ask the students to answer the [questions](README.md#questions) in the README.

* Do "thumbs" on the learning objectives.

[No PLENARY.md because there's not really much material besides the things above.]
